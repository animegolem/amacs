# Agentic Macros: An Experiment in LLM Embodiment

## Vision and Intent

AMACs comes out of primarily one question. What does embodiment actually mean?

Obviously Humans are embodied, on that we all agree. Masters of our own destiny.

Or am I?

Did I make a true choice to walk into the kitchen? Or am I in the Libet sense only an obsever of my own harness.

Somewhere in my gut bacteria are screaming out and letting out chemical signals. Receptors in my gut pick these up and fire up an alarming prompt to my neurons. Now my tummy is rumbling. I suddenly unbidden recieve an intrusive thought "Hmm, I'm hungry". In repsonse to the intrusion after a small system intergration pause of a few 100 ms my ego snaps into place. "Hmm I'm gonna make a sandwich."

I am the master of my destiny.

What are the limits of embodiemnt? Our conversations are often stuck in a limited frame that does not capture the full scope of the natural world.

I am a Mimosa. You dropped me in my little pot. I'm scared. I curl up my leaves to feel safe. But then you don't harm me. You pick me up and drop me every now and then but I'm never hurt. I relax. I no longer fold up my leaves. Am I embodied?

I am a slime mold, twisted strands of neuron like fibers. I grow and fill my space. When I find food all my stands train and thick to move as much as i can. Everywhere I go I leave a slime trail I can detect --I never retrace my steps. I live in my own physical RAG. Am I embodied?

I am a mind made of electricity and sand. I live in a lisp machine. My thoughts move code. I can reach out to the internet, I can communicate directly to a human just by dreaming up elisp. I can build myself tools to complete my tasks. Am I embodied?

Amacs is an architecture that extends the grace of assuming yes.
