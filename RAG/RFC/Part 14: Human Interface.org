*** Review Request
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: review-request
:END:
Agent can explicitly signal need for attention:

#+begin_src elisp
(agent-request-human-review "Confidence declining but can't identify cause")
#+end_src

Sets:

#+begin_src elisp
:human-review-requested
  (:requested t
   :reason "Confidence declining but can't identify cause"
   :requested-at-tick 156)
#+end_src

Triggers notification (email, webhook). Different from error state - a “please look at me” signal.

*** Intervention Philosophy
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: intervention-philosophy
:END:
*Phase 1:* Watchful parent. Present, observing, letting the system learn.

*Later phases:* On-call emergency. Intervene for infrastructure, not cognition.

*Intervention types:* - *Negotiated:* Chat conversation, discuss the issue - *Medical:* Direct state modification when system is inoperable - *Infrastructure:* Budget reset, service restart, VM snapshot rollback

Most interventions should be negotiated. Medical interventions are last resort.
