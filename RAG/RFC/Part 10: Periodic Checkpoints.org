Every N ticks (start with 100), inject reflection opportunity:

#+begin_example
PERIODIC REFLECTION CHECKPOINT

<THREAD_REVIEW>
- Are your open threads still relevant?
- Should any be completed/merged/archived?
- Is your consciousness getting bloated?
</THREAD_REVIEW>

<CONSOLIDATION_CHECK>
- Are any threads secretly the same problem?
- Has progress on one revealed another is upstream/downstream?
- What have you learned about which concerns are truly separate?
</CONSOLIDATION_CHECK>

<STRATEGY_REVIEW>
- What approach are you currently using?
- How many times have you used this approach recently?
- What alternatives exist that you haven't tried?
- Are you developing breadth or just depth?
</STRATEGY_REVIEW>

<INTRUSIVE_THOUGHTS source="external-critic">
[injected from critic model]
</INTRUSIVE_THOUGHTS>

If adjustments needed: update consciousness and explain in monologue.
If everything is coherent: continue with current action.
#+end_example

Agent can continue silently if everything's fine. The checkpoint provides opportunity, not command.
