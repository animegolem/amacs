The main agent is /in/ the flow, optimizing locally. The critic is /outside/, checking for gaps between intent and behavior.

Like OCD intrusive thoughts: you don't choose them, they arrive. Agency is in the response, not the receipt.

*** Implementation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: implementation
:END:
Every N ticks (checkpoint interval):

#+begin_example
1. Assemble main agent context

2. Parallel call to critic (gemini-flash or haiku):
   - Same consciousness snapshot
   - Prompt: "Review this agent's state. What are they missing? 
     What pattern are they stuck in? What did they say they'd do 
     that they haven't? 1-2 paragraphs max."

3. Inject into main agent prompt:

   <INTRUSIVE_THOUGHTS source="external-critic">
   [critic output]
   </INTRUSIVE_THOUGHTS>
   
   These thoughts are external observations. You maintain full 
   agency over whether to incorporate them.

4. Main agent proceeds with full autonomy.

| Problem               | Critic Observation                                             |
|-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Strategy ossification | “You've tried this approach 9 times”                           |
| Plan drift            | “You said you'd catch an Oddish but you're walking to the gym” |
| Tunnel vision         | “There's an unexplored option you haven't considered”          |
| Coherence gaps        | “Your thread says X but your action implies Y”                 |

*Cost:* ~$0.005/checkpoint with cheap model. Negligible.
