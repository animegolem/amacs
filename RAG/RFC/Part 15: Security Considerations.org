*** Threat Model
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: threat-model
:END:
The agent can do anything within its airgapped body. Security is: 1. *Containment:* Body cannot reach internet or local network 2. *Inspection:* All API calls route through brain, observable 3. *Rollback:* VM snapshots enable recovery from any state 4. *Watchdog:* Services restart if hung

We are NOT trying to prevent the agent from “escaping” through clever prompting. We are ensuring that even total compromise of the body VM has bounded impact.

*** The Spinal Cord Rule
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: the-spinal-cord-rule
:END:
Agent cannot modify: - VSock plumbing (communication channels) - Core systemd services (cortex-listener, commit-hooks) - Consciousness serialization (must persist correctly) - The snapshot/rollback mechanism

Everything else is fair game for experimentation.

*** CI/CD Security (Phase 3)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cicd-security-phase-3
:END:
When agent can push Containerfile changes: - Gitea runner builds in isolation - Network fetch requires explicit approval - Successful build triggers snapshot before deploy - Failed builds don't deploy

Agent can request new tools. Human approves network access. Build happens offline.
