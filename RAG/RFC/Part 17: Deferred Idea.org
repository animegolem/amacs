#+title: Part 17 Deferred Idea

** Part 17: Deferred Ideas
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: part-17-deferred-ideas
:END:
These are potentially valuable but not needed for initial phases.

*** Agent-Adjustable Sampling Parameters
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: agent-adjustable-sampling-parameters
:END:
Let agent request temp/top_p changes for bounded periods:

#+begin_src elisp
:cognitive-mode
  (:temperature 0.9
   :adjusted-at-tick 145
   :revert-at-tick 155
   :reason "stuck, trying divergent approach")
#+end_src

Time-gated with API-side cap. Like Mythic chaos factor.

*Defer until:* Evidence agent gets stuck in basins that temperature would help.

*** Dream Urgency Accumulator
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: dream-urgency-accumulator
:END:
Multi-signal integration for consolidation timing:

#+begin_src elisp
(defun agent-bump-dream-urgency (&key commits threads monologue-growth gap-seconds)
  (incf agent-dream-urgency
        (+ (* 0.001 commits)
           (* 0.20 threads)
           (* 0.0005 monologue-growth)
           (if (> gap-seconds 3600) 0.5 0.0))))
#+end_src

*Defer until:* Simple “every N ticks” proves insufficient.

*** Model Selection as Agent Choice
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: model-selection-as-agent-choice
:END:
Agent decides which oracle (Claude/GPT/Gemini) based on task.

*Defer until:* Evidence different models are better for different tasks.

*** Full Worker Branch Isolation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: full-worker-branch-isolation
:END:
Git worktrees per worker, merge on success.

*Defer until:* Workers actually cause problems isolation would solve.
